# Circulo Datasets 

###Summary
This directory contains the python scripts that download the individual datasets for the Circulo framework.  Each subdirectory represents a single dataset. Each dataset is converted into graphml and stored in the [GRAPHS](circulo/data/GRAPHS) directory by the run.py script. As such, run.py is responsible for downloading and converting raw data into a graphml formatted file.  Each run.py script must contain a class that inherits from the CirculoData class found in the [databot](circulo/data/databot.py) module.  


###How do I add a new dataset?

The key to understanding how to import a dataset into Circulo is to be familiar with the CirculoData class in the [databot](circulo/data/databot.py) module. We'll pretend our new dataset is called "friends".  To import the friends dataset into the Circulo framework, follow these steps:

1. Create a new subdirectory with a name describing the new dataset: `mkdir friends`
2. Create the python file `friends/run.py` and be sure that `run.py` contains a class that inherits from CirculoData. In this case, we will call the class `FriendsData`. 
3. Copy the README template into the new directory, naming it `README.md`: `cp README_template.md friends/README.md`. Be sure to be as thorough as possible when writing the README so that others will understand your dataset.
4. Override the necessary functions from the CirculoData class in the FriendsData class in `run.py`.  Please see other `run.py` files for examples.  The amount of code required in the `run.py` file largely depends on how close the original data is to a graph format. 
5. Add a row to the Dataset Index in this README.
